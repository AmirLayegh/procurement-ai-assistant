// This file is a placeholder. The actual useSidebar should be imported from '@/components/ui/sidebar'
// if it's correctly defined and exported there.
// If `useSidebar` from `@/components/ui/sidebar` causes issues due to context visibility,
// this file could be used to provide a shim or a re-export.

// For now, we assume `@/components/ui/sidebar` exports `useSidebar` correctly.
// If not, this would be the place to provide a working version or adjust imports.

// Re-exporting to ensure consistency if we needed to modify it.
